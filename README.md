🧪 Voice Agent Lab

Voice Agent Lab is an experimental playground for building, testing, and iterating on AI-powered voice agents end-to-end — from speech input to intelligent response and audio output.

This repository focuses on practical pipelines, not demos:
speech → representation → reasoning → synthesis.

🔧 What this repo explores

🎙️ Speech processing & representation

Audio ingestion, feature extraction (e.g. MFCCs, mel-spectrograms)

Phase-aware audio reconstruction

🧠 Intelligent agents

LLM-driven reasoning and dialogue flow

Emotion-aware and context-sensitive responses

🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Neural TTS engines (including local inference setups)

Emotion transfer and expressiveness experiments

🔁 End-to-end voice pipelines

ASR → reasoning → TTS

Latency-aware, locally runnable workflows

🎯 Goals

Build modular, hackable voice agents

Experiment with emotion, prosody, and expressiveness

Keep everything local-first where possible (GPU-friendly)

Serve as a research + engineering sandbox, not a black box

🧩 Tech stack (evolving)

Python

Local LLMs

ASR & TTS models

Audio DSP libraries

GPU acceleration (CUDA)

🚧 Status

This is an active lab, not a polished product.
Expect rapid iteration, breaking changes, and experimental ideas.
