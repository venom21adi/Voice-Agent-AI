# Voice Agent Lab

> An experimental lab for building end-to-end AI voice agents — from speech understanding to expressive speech synthesis.

---

## Overview

**Voice Agent Lab** is a hands-on experimentation space for designing, testing, and iterating on modern voice agents.  
The focus is on **real, modular pipelines**, not toy demos.

This repo explores the full voice stack:

**Speech → Understanding → Reasoning → Synthesis**

## What’s Inside

### 🎙 Speech & Audio
- Audio ingestion and preprocessing  
- Feature extraction (MFCCs, mel-spectrograms)  
- Phase-aware audio reconstruction  

### 🧠 Intelligence
- LLM-driven reasoning and dialogue control  
- Context-aware and emotion-aware responses  

### 🗣 Speech Synthesis
- Neural TTS (local inference setups)  
- Prosody and emotion transfer experiments  

### 🔁 Pipelines
- ASR → reasoning → TTS workflows  
- Latency-aware, GPU-friendly execution

## Design Philosophy

- **Local-first** whenever possible  
- **Composable components**, not monoliths  
- Built for **experimentation**, not polish  
- Optimized for **learning and iteration**

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Local LLMs  
- ASR & TTS models  
- Audio DSP libraries  
- CUDA / GPU acceleration  

---

## Project Status

**⚠️ Experimental / Active Development**

This repository is a lab environment.  
Expect rapid iteration, breaking changes, and exploratory work.

---

## Why this exists

Most voice-agent examples stop at demos.  
This repo exists to push deeper into **expressiveness, emotion, and real-world constraints**.
